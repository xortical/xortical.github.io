      I am single, unmarried, without any debt or diseases. </p>
      <p>I have a PhD in nanotechnology and I co-founded a microrobotics startup. </p>
    <p>You can look at my <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wsMAWL0AAAAJ&hl=en">research</a> and <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debayan-dasgupta-b2360856/">cv</a> and decide if you would want to invest in me. This is a social experiment in outsourcing my life choices. 
      If you buy NFTs to control my life, it is in your (and my) best interest to make the best choices for my future.
